Week 4 Tasks 
===========

Task 1:
 * What will be printed by this block of c++ code?
 * in File Name "doubleUntilLimit.cpp"
	
int n = 10;
while (n < 50) 
{ 
n = n * 2; 
}
cout << n << endl;

A. 10 
B. 40 
C. 50 
D. 80

 * Answere: D. 80


Task2:
------

 * Write a programme that prints even numbers between 0 and 100
 * in File name "evenNum.cpp"

    int num =100;

    //printing even number from 0 to 100
    cout << "Even: ";
    for(int i = 2; i <= 100; i+=2)
    {
        cout << i<< " ";
    }

    cout<< endl;

Task 3:
-------

 * Write a programme that prints the odd numbers between 0 and 100.
 * in File name "oddNum.cpp"

    int num =100;

    //printing even number from 0 to 100
    cout << "Even: ";
    for(int i = 2; i <= 100; i+=2)
    {
        cout << i<< " ";
    }

    cout<< endl;


Task 4:
------

 * Write the factorial program. It should return the product of all the numbers from 1 to the parameter n. For example, when the user enters: 5, it should return 120 because 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Think about what kind of loop you want to use to accomplish this.
 * in File nume "factorial.cpp"

    int num;
    int fact = 1;
    //asking user to input a number
    cout<< "Number ";
    cin >> num ;

    // check if user input a number less than one
    if (num < 1 )
    {
        cout<< "Invalid Number!"<<endl;
    }else
    {
        //calculating factorial of the number
        cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is ";
        for(; num >1; num--)
        {
            fact *= num;
        }
        cout << fact <<endl;
    }


Task 5:
-------

 * using loop print this 
	####
	###
	##
	#
 * in File name "reverseTriangle.cpp"

// code
    int num = 4;

    for (int i =0; i <num ; i++)
    {
        for(int j= 1; j <= num-i ; j++)
        {
            cout << "#";
        }
        cout <<endl;
    }
